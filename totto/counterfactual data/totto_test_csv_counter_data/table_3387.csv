UY Scuti#1,708±192#AD#This value was based on an angular diameter and distance of 2.9 kpc. Gaia DR2 suggests a closer distance and consequently smaller radius.
WOH G64#1,540–2,575#L/Teff#This would be the largest star in the LMC, but is unusual in position and motion and might still be a foreground halo giant.

VY Canis Majoris#1,420–2,000#AD#VY CMa is described as the largest star in the Milky Way although galactic red supergiants above are possibly larger but they have less accurate radius estimates.
KY Cygni#1,420–2,850#L/Teff#The upper estimate is due to an unusual K-band measurement and thought to be an artifact of a reddening correction error, and is thought to be against stellar evolutionary theory.
AH Scorpii#1,411±124#AD#AH Sco is variable by nearly 3 magnitudes in the visual range, and an estimated 20% in total luminosity. The variation in diameter is not clear because the temperature also varies.
